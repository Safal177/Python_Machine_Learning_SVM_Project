# Python machine learning: Support Vector Machine (SVM) project

# Objective: 
Present my skills to evaluate a model used in SVM with visualization in a Python environment. This project is included in my portfolio. 
# Project Outline:
Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis on “mouse_viral_study.csv” dataset using some kernels, hyperparameters, and GridSearchCV including boundary visualization
# Main Skills:
•	Data loading
•	Use matplotlib and seaborn to visualize data
•	SVM model
•	Hyperparameters with GridSearchCV
•	Visualize boundaries in many kernels:
# Dataset:
•	Collect the ('mouse_viral_study.csv') from Kaggle
•	License: CC BY-SA 4.0.
.# Steps used to run the project:
•	Load data
•	Visualize data
•	Use SVM modeling: some kernels such as linear, radial basis function (rbf), polynomial degrees from 1 to 4, Sigmoid, experiments on different c  and gamma values.  
•	SVM model visualization: Plot boundaries on the dataset using the plot_svm_boundary function
•	Hyperparameter tuning: Apply GridSearchCV. Best parameters listed in the pdf file
# Tools:
•	Python
•	NumPy
•	Pandas
•	Matplotlib
•	Seaborn
•	SVM
